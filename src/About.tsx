        <p className="text-lg mb-3">I don't really think there's much to it, I'm from West Hollywood, CA and I like to make clothes that actually feel like something. Just under two years ago I realized there was nothing I owned or could buy that felt like me.</p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-3">So often when you buy clothes you think of how others would see you in them or how they've looked on others, and each piece is put into a category. There's words like 'style', 'fit', 'gender', 'season', and certainly many more that contribute to clothes being seen in an unhealthy way. I don't need someone telling me how to wear MY clothes, and I'm sure others feel the same. </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-3">All my clothes are unisex and can be tailored to any given person's unique expression. </p>
